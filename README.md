It's a recipe bookmarking 📖 app... It's a shopping list 🛒 app... It's Kitchen Sink Squared! 

Grocery shopping and recipes are pretty well-known domains that makes it easy to spike out and play around with different ideas within those domains.

I like picking up new technologies, languages, frameworks, etc., and implementing _something_ with them to get a good feel for how they work, or just for the thrill of doing something new.

So... 🥁 enter Kitchen Sink Squared! This is basically a repository in which I try out different technologies, frameworks, languages, you name it, building some interesting feature that is loosely related to the kitchen.

A recipe bookmarking app? You bet!

A shared shopping list app? ✅

Meal scheduling, allowing you to select an indexed recipe, pre-populating a shopping list, informed by historical data of recipes you've chosen before to guess at which ingredients you need or already have? 🤷‍♂️ that sounds cool!
